# Renovate Runner

This repository uses [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) in combination with GitHub Actions workflow to automatically manage and update dependencies on specified repositories.

## Why is this important?

Keeping dependencies up to date is crucial for several reasons:

- **Security**: Outdated dependencies often contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
  
- **Bug Fixes and Improvements**: Newer versions of dependencies often come with important bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.

- **Reducing Technical Debt**: Regular updates prevent your project from falling behind and make it easier to maintain in the long run. Skipping too many updates can lead to outdated dependencies that are difficult and costly to upgrade later.
